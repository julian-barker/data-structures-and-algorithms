## Comparators

### Problem Domain

Write two comparator functions to pass into the native `Array.prototype.sort()` method. The comparator functions should sort a list of movies (objects) by a specified property of the movie.

- The first function should sort by the release year
- The second function should sort by the title
  - Note that the function should ignore leading articles such as 'The', 'A', and 'An'
